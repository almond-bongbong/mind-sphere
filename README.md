## 🌌 Overview

**StarSphere** is an interactive 3D visualization that represents data categories as points distributed across a sphere. Each category occupies a specific longitudinal segment, allowing for clear visual differentiation. The points, or "stars," shimmer and rotate, creating a captivating and immersive experience.

## ✨ Features

- 🗂 **Categorical Segmentation**: Data points are organized by category, each assigned to a specific longitudinal section of the sphere.
- 🌠 **Dynamic Animation**: Stars gently twinkle and pulsate, enhancing the visual appeal.
- 🎮 **Interactive Controls**: Users can rotate, zoom, and pan the sphere.
- 🎨 **Custom Shaders**: Utilizes custom GLSL shaders for advanced rendering effects.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes, adjusting camera settings for optimal viewing.
